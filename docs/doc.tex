\section{Introduction and objectives}
In this report we will describe the work done for the mid-course project of the course Cyber-Physical Systems and IoT security. 
The paper to which we refer is \textbf{\cite{Cho2016} \citetitle{Cho2016}} where is explained the design of an algorithm: the CIDS (Clock-based Intrusion Detection System), that is able to detect different kinds of attack. In this paper is shown the functioning of three kinds of attack: the "Fabbrication attack", the "Suspension attack" and the "Masquerade attack". What we tried to do was to implement the three attacks and the CIDS algorithm in a simulation environemnt using \textbf{ICSim}, instead of physically as shown in the paper.
\section{System setup}
We worked on a virtual machine with \textbf{LinuxMint22} as operating system.
The simulator used is \textbf{ICSim}. All the code is written in \textbf{Python} and can be found at the following link: .% \url{}
We used the \textbf{can library} to create messages and to simulate the communication of the attackers with the ECUs.
